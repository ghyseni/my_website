      <h3>Other interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Web surfing</h4>
          <p>
            I find this as a nice way to of being up to date with what's out there. It also gives me a good view of the web design that are being used, or the programming techniques developers are using and be up to date with the new technologies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Reading</h4>
          <p>
            Apart from Web surfing and getting information from there. A hardcopy book will give me the advantage of being focused in one thing at a time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Movies, TV Shows</h4>
          <p>
            Movies have been part of my life since I can remember, I always find time to enjoy a good movie or relax with an episode of a TV Show. I used to love fantasy and action, but in the end it's always about the movie production.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Outdors</h4>
          <p>
            I was grown to love outdoors as I spent most of my time as a kid just being outside. I spent most of my time inside now but I am always up for a sit on the front yard, an walk in the evening or a weekend on the mountains.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Travelling</h4>
          <p>
            When I say travelling I really mean it: from being in the car/train/plane which gives you time to relax, read or listen to an audio book, or even just daydream a bit - up to going and seeing places you've only heard about or those you had no idea existed.
