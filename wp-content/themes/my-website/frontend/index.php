      <h2> Website and Application Developer</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working with web development for more than two and a half years now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've developed quite a broad skill set including: understanding client needs and requirements, team work, time management, project management, technical skills and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Task driven approach is what I've been using so far to meet the requirements and the deadlines with efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        After work, traveling is my passion!
